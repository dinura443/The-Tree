Java program that generates an ASCII tree structure in the console. The tree consists of a trunk and branches

Features

Generates an ASCII tree with customizable trunk and branches

Uses |, /, and \ characters to create a realistic trunk

Structured with Main, Assembler, and Assets classes for modularity

How It Works,

Main.java initializes the program and calls the assembler.

Assembler.java constructs the tree structure in a grid format.

Assets.java provides different patterns for branches and trunks.

The final output is displayed as an ASCII tree in the console.
