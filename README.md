# Tree (JAVA)
# The method Leaves are still work in progress!!



![TreeDemo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc7ce8eb-a17f-47d5-a8c0-aaa7ac9f2425)


A simple Java program that generates an ASCII tree structure in the console. The tree consists of a trunk and branches, with varying character details to create a natural, uneven appearance.

Features

Generates an ASCII tree with customizable trunk and branches

Uses |, /, and \ characters to create a realistic trunk

Allows different levels of tree complexity

Structured with Main, Assembler, and Assets classes for modularity

How It Works

Main.java initializes the program and calls the assembler.

Assembler.java constructs the tree structure in a grid format.

Assets.java provides different patterns for branches and trunks.

The final output is displayed as an ASCII tree in the console.
